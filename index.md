# Hello!
I'm Dana Callista Lexa, also known on some platforms as @authorx. I like making things, and collaborating in making things, like podcasts, games, and other silly projects. Here are some of the things I've made that I'm proud of:

* Podcasts
    * Such as: [SuperIdols! RPG](https://superidolsrpg.wordpress.com/)
* Games and supplements
    * Such as: [Motion and Stillness - Two Moons for Realis](https://author-x.itch.io/motion-and-stillness)
* Code
    * Such as: [Dialogue Blocks for Publii](https://github.com/AuthorX/PubliiDialogueBlocks)
