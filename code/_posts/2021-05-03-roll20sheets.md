I have created a few character sheets for games on Roll20, though I don't have the subscription to continue developing them now.

## Hard Wired Island

## Fellowship

[Fellowship](https://liberigothica.itch.io/fellowship-a-tabletop-adventure-game) by Vel Mini

The character sheet was created between the first and second edition of Fellowship, and has not been updated for Fellowship 2e. I believe it will largely work with 2e but will be missing some playbooks, including most of the expansions, and may have some inconsistencies with the book where existing playbooks were updated.

## Masks: A New Generation

I added added the Soldier and Brain character sheets to the Masks character sheet, however since then another contributor overhauled the Masks sheet, so I don't know if I can take credit for any current part of the sheet.
