Hello! I'm Dana Callista Lexa (feel free to call my any of those), a trans woman in the tabletop RPG and AP podcast space. I've also use the handle "AuthorX" since the early 00's (if you remember the Bob and George forums - hello, fellow old person!) so if you see someone with that handle, there's a good chance that's me as well.

I mostly just exist online as a hobbyist and hang out with friends, but tabletop rpgs and podcasts are a common interest, and I have the pleasure of being on a few podcasts as well, and occasionally make small RPG products, like one-pager RPGs or supplements for existing games. Because of the transient nature of online social spaces - having moved from tumblr to twitter to cohost (rip) and now bluesky - I decided to make a personal site to collect those projects in one place (in some cases, linking to where you can find them, in other cases preserving them here).

Also, if you're wondering about the "2x Award-Winning Podcaster" moniker, it's half-joke, half reminder to myself to take pride in my work. Some years ago there was a set of twitter-poll-based awards for actual play podcasts using the Masks system, called The Superlatives. My show, SuperIdols! RPG, and other cast members from it, won several awards, and in particular I personally won the award for "Most Creative Doom" for my character Violence Violet, using the Doomed playbook to represent an idol in a predatory recording contract. And again the following year! The actual "award" is both very niche, and has since been wiped from the face of the internet, but I still like to refer to myself as "2x Award-Winning Podcaster Dana Lexa" to remind myself that I've made something people really like, enough to vote for it in a twitter award show.
