[Berserk B.I.T.S](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2348540/Berserk_BITS/) is an idle/auto-battler game (with clear inspiration from the Mega Man Battle Network series) created by BerserkBoy games, which allows users to create custom characters by replacing the player sprites.

Once I downloaded it, I immediately wanted to try making my own character, and settled on the OC Vixie, created by my friend, Millie. You can find more about Vixie [here](https://bsky.app/profile/diddgery.bsky.social/post/3lgo2qgkdo22d). I specifically used VIX-13, the robot version of Vixie, as the inspiration, and [this sketch](https://bsky.app/profile/diddgery.bsky.social/post/3lh65fz4bvs2f) of VIX-13, as the basis for the character mugshot. Here are some more images of VIX-13 in-game as well as the custom BIT file and instructions below.

Many thanks to Millie for the inspiration, suggestions and encouragement during development, the use of the VIX-13 sketch for the mugshot, and being a good friend!
