A few times, I've been inspired to write a micro RPG directly on twitter. Given the slow death of the platform, I wanted to preserve them here.

## Costumes, a 364-day RPG

> Costumes, a 364-day RPG
>
> What kind of monster are you?
> 
> Which of your monstrous features is the most visible? Which are you most proud of? Which are you most ashamed of?
> 
> For each, how do you painfully, uncomfortably, or tediously remove or hide them to appear human?

Example of play:

> I'm a harpy. My most visible and proud features are my feathers, which let me soar through the sky. I am ashamed of my voice, which is harsh and painful to hear.
> 
> Every week I meticulously pluck any newly-growing feathers, and I lower my voice to a barely audible whisper.

## Slime Rancher RPG

> Slime Rancher RPG:
> A. Get a random adjective, this a slime you just discovered.
> B. Write a letter to your distant partner about it, and how your ranch is doing!
> C. Roll a die for how long until you write your next letter.
> 1: Day 2: 3 days 3: Week 4: Month 5: Season 6: Year
> Repeat

> Appendices:
> Here's a random adjective generator: https://randomwordgenerator.com/adjective.php
> 
> "Physically distant or emotionally distant?"
> How good are you at telling the difference?

> Appendix C: Maybe draw a sketch of your newly discovered slime with your letter, maybe interacting with other slimes on your ranch?
> 
> Appendix D: Your new slime type doesn't have to be a new species, ie a Chief Slime might just be one slime the others listen to. With a cute hat.
